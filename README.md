# 🚨 IoT-Enabled Smoke Detection System 🚨

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project builds upon the successful implementation of a Real-Time Smoking Detection System that combines **YOLOv5**, **thermal heat detection**, **hand gesture analysis**, and **machine learning** to accurately detect smoking behavior. The enhanced physical implementation integrates **IoT functionality**, **multi-sensor capabilities**, and **data analysis** to provide a comprehensive safety solution.

## 🛠️ Hardware Components
- 🖥️ **Arduino Nano**: Acts as the central controller for processing sensor data.
- 🌫️ **MQ-2 Gas Sensor**: Detects smoke and gas with a sensitivity range of 200 ppm to 10,000 ppm.
- 📏 **Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (HC-SR04)**: Measures distances from 2 cm to 400 cm with a ±3 mm precision.
- 🌡️ **Thermal Camera**: Captures temperature variations for early fire detection.
- 📟 **LCD Display (16x2 with I2C interface)**: Displays real-time smoke concentration, temperature, and distance measurements.
- 🔊 **Active Buzzer Module**: Provides immediate auditory alerts.
- ⚡ Breadboard and jumper wires: Ensure an efficient and compact design.

## ⭐ Key Features
- 🌐 **IoT Integration**: Sends real-time alerts to a server and mobile phone upon detecting smoke or abnormal temperature changes.
- 🌫️ **Smoke and Gas Detection**: Accurately identifies hazardous concentration levels.
- 🌡️ **Temperature Monitoring**: Detects sudden spikes or anomalies for fire prevention.
- 📏 **Distance Measurement**: Adds an additional layer of safety with proximity monitoring.
